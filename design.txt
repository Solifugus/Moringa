TODO

	[ ] Prioritize interpretation of explicit word over variable, in recognizer
        (might have already done this)
	[ ] Complete merging
		[ ] For pre-existing recognizer, add everything under it.
		[ ] For pre-existing context, merge with context.

The MoringaScript Language

----------------
Structural Terms

context "name"
	Anything commands hereafter until the next "context" directive is
	considered part of the context thus named.  Only the "base" context is
	active by default.  Others become active when entered and inactive when
	exited.  When interpreting input, matching recognizers are run through 
	all active contexts from most to least recently entered.  

	When a recognizer is matched in any context (except for "base"), that
	context becomes the most recent.

Recognizer "{pattern}"\n
	{action commands to always do if recognized}
	[Exclusive] [Last] Option\n
		{action commands to do if option is chosen}
	[Exclusive] [Last] Option If {condition}\n
		{action commands to do if condition is true and option is chosen}

	-------
	pattern

	A pattern may contain any visible characters between whitespace.  Any
	whitespace characters in front or on the end are ignored.  Any whitespace
	characters within are used to separate words. Any visible characters
	other than letters or numbers are viewed as words themselves.  

	However, variables may be embedded in a pattern by encasing the variable
	name in square brackets.  In a read operation, whatever text is found in
	the space of the variable up to the next word in the patter is assigned
	to that variable as its value.  In a write operation, any value assigned
	to the variable is inserted else its name (if no value is assigned to it).
	Also in a write operation, if the variable name starts with "group:" the 
	only acceptible word must be one in the group so named.

	All patterns are defined within quotes.  However, if a quote or a 
	square bracket needs to be part of a pattern then it may be escaped with
	a backslash, such as \", \[, \], or \\.

	Variables.  Anything within square brackets are considered variables.

	Litterals.  Anything enclosed within backtics (under the ~ key) is 
	considered a character-by-character litteral.

	---------
	condition
	
	A condition statement evaluates to true or false.  If true, the respective
	option is elligible to be chosen.  A condition may comprise any combination
	of patterns, numbers, numeric comparators (">",">=","<>","<","<="), filters
	("Including", "Excluding"), or logical operators ("and","or","not").

	A pattern will evaluate to the number of matches in memory.  Zero is equal
	to False and anything else is equal to True.

	In a condition, the pattern is in both a read and write operation, even
	though nothing is written to memory.  If a variable is assigned then its
	value is placed in the pattern before reading from memory.  Anything else
	is assigned from memory when the pattern is found.

	
	---------------------------
	Decision Driving Directives

		Seek {number}% {condition}
		Avoid {number}% {condition}

	Increasing or decreasing a percentage, alters any other respective Seeks
	or Avoids such as to leave a total of 100% at all times.



---------------
Action Commands

	Say "{output pattern}" [timing]
	Remember "{output pattern}" [timing]
	Recall "{input pattern} [timing]
	Expect "{input pattern}" As "{output pattern}" [timing]
	Interpret As "{output pattern}" [timing]
	Enter Context "{name of context}" [timing] [{ ..context definition.. }]
	Exit Context ["name of context"] [timing]


---------------------------------------
Personality Modeling Commands

	To "{output pattern}" {action command}	
	Create personality "{output pattern}" From "{output pattern}"

	Respo
	

	The commands to work with different personality models need to be able to
	create variably-named instances of personality templates, to execute 
	commands on it, and to communicate with it in condition expressions.

Moringa Engine's Processing Sequence

User messages are passed into the Moringa engine through the ".send(message)"
method.  Any instant responses are returned by that method.  However, delayed
responses may be passed to a callback.  By default, the callback is that
passed into Moringa's constructor.  However, you may over-ride then with each
call to the ".send(message,callback)" method by adding the callback.  A 
callback so added would only apply to that specific call.  

(1) Run everything in the global space.

The global space is from the beginning of a script to the first Recognizer 
declaration.  It may be (correctly) assumed that this global space is a special
recognizer that processes immediately after reception of each user message.  So
it may contain any action commands or even any kind of option declaration.

(2) Contexts are processed in order of most to least recently entered.

Each may have its own global area and list of recognizers.  This is all
processed the same as the main script for its order in the script.

(3) Recognizers

Within each context and then again after all contexts (in the foundation), 
recognizers evaluate against the user message starting with the longest to the
shortest, accepting the one that is first found to match.  A recognizer's 
"reaction" is everything coded from after it to just before the next recognizer
declaration or the end of the script.

Amid a recognizer's reaction, any commands before the first option declaration
is executed.  After this, the Moringa engine determines what options are 
elligible for chosing.  Any options without conditions or with conditions 
evaluating to true are deemed elligible.  If none are thus found to elligible 
and then any "Last Option" may be evaluated for elligibility.

Notes and Thoughts for Further Development

	[ ] Change "betweens" to "befores","withins", and "afters" in relation to 
	each segment.
	[ ] Add input stream processing of multiple recognizers per input, adding
	"betweens" as being unrecognized between recognized. 
	[ ] Build loggins option
	[ ] Enabling marking of each segment as subject, verb, or object.
	This can be used to identify new subjects, objects, and perhaps verbs.
