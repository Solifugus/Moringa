Use the 3Max Rule

Unless specifically asking to list information, questions should be replied to
with the maximum of 1 to 3 possible answers.  If more than 3 answers exist then
see if there are any 3 or fewer categories they can fall under and list those.
If not, give the number of responses and ask for more specificity in the 
question.
